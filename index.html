      <p>  Earning my Bachelor in Business and Administration (BBA) in Hospitality Management and Finance from the renowned Glion Institute of Higher Education, I have built a successful career spanning over a decade, with unique experiences across diverse industries and locations worldwide. These experiences have honed me into an adaptable and driven leader.

        Throughout my journey, I have worked across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the United States, amassing valuable insights into different cultures, business environments, and customer expectations. My diverse background has allowed me to master cross-cultural communication and collaboration while gaining an in-depth understanding of international markets.

        I began my career in the hospitality industry with esteemed organizations such as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Sofitel Luxury Hotels and Resorts, and InterContinental Hotels & Resorts. I held various roles in Food & Beverage management, acquiring crucial knowledge in customer service, team management, and revenue generation.

        I then devoted over four years to LRA by Deloitte, the premier global provider of Brand Protection and Customer Experience Measurement services for multinational companies. My progression from Consultant to Operations Manager, EMEA, allowed me to work with leading hotel groups and enhance my comprehension of customer needs and exceptional customer experiences.

        My tenure at LRA by Deloitte has given me a solid foundation in customer-centric thinking, and a deep appreciation for brand integrity in today's competitive landscape.

        As I advanced in my career, I spent six rewarding years at Equinix, the global leader in data center services, rising through the ranks from Sr. Customer Success Manager to Head of Customer Success, Southern Europe. In this role, I managed crisis situations, oversaw a $20M MRR portfolio, and maintained an impressive NPS of 32 in 2021. I participated in facilitating the successful integration of ITConic Spain & Portugal and Telecity France & Italy into Equinix. I take pride in my low employee turnover rate (4% per year on average) and my talent for leading and nurturing high-performing teams. My time at Equinix has provided me with invaluable insights into the technology industry, further expanding my expertise..</p>
